It reads that it\u0027ll always disable data if the bool is not true.\n\nLooking at the same place in cm-14.1, if I\u0027ve read correctly, all the bool did at this point was disable checking whether or not data was disabled in settings.\n\nReverting this gerrit seems to solve a recent issue where mms no longer send/recv if wifi is connected.  (razorloves suggested it might be this patch)",
